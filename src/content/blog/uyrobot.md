A project I’m very proud to have been involved with is finally live: [UYRobot](http://www.uyrobot.com.uy/). Among other things, they teach both kids and adults how to build robots.

The site was a collaborative effort with designer [Flavia Calandria](https://www.flaviacalandria.com/).

The tech used was React (through Create React App) & SASS, with Express on the backend. Although I’m currently thinking of migrating it to Next.js to provide server side rendering. The site is also hosted on Heroku for staging.

The full source code of the site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/HiroAgustin/uy-robot/).
